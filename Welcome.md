Welcome to the SampSharp documentation website.

SampSharp is a framework for writing game modes for [SA-MP](http://sa-mp.com) in C# or any other .NET language. SA-MP is a free Massively Multiplayer Online game mod for the PC version of Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. While the current version of SampSharp is fully functional it is important to note that it is still in beta features may be changed or removed if deemed necessary.

The plugin works both on Linux and Windows. The framework contains various classes for every type of resource available in SA-MP (players, vehicles, textdraws, etc). Aside from this wrapper around native functions, the library also contains a good structure to build your game mode on.

SampSharp provides wrappers for existing plugins (currently only the streamer plugin) and a number of resources for writing wrappers for existing plugins. There are also a small number of example gamemodes available.

**NOTICE:** The instructions need updating! Some example code may no longer work. I'll try to update it over the next few weeks.
