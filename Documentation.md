Contributing
------------
If you'd like to help SampSharp by improving or adding to the documentation, you are more than welcome to! Don't hesitate to press that edit button! The [documentation website] has an `edit this page on github` link next to the title of every page. All you need is a (free) github account.

Markdown Syntax
---------------
The documentation is written using the markdown language. If you need help with the markdown syntax you can find a great guide [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Keep in mind that the [documentation website] might parse the markdown slightly differently as github might do, but generally all markdown syntax which works on Github will work on SampSharp's website as well.

Page Layout
-----------
Every page should start with an index with every paragraph on the page. The links should start of with a hash (#), followed by the lowercase name of the paragraph. For example, the index of this page looks as follows:

```

- [Markdown Syntax](#markdown-syntax)
- [Page Layout](#page-layout)
```

If you need any help, feel free to send an issue.
